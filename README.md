# Purely Functional Data Structures in Go
An implementation of the immutable data structures in Okasaki's textbook, "Purely Functional Data Structures", in Go.

## Requirements
A compiler supporting Generics is necessary; Go 1.17 with `-gcflags=-G=3` flag

## Disclaimers
* I want to compare the time and memory efficiency of PFDS in Go vs. [PFDS in C++](https://github.com/takkyu2/purely-functional-data-structures), but, as you know, benchmarking is difficult, so I am not sure I can make it.
